# Week 2 NOTES

## Review stuff from questions
* arc function - check the reference and don't forget radians
* CHORD connects two points
* use radians() to convert degrees to radians
* strokeWeight() controls the weight of all strokes


## Variables
* what's in the baax
* use let (pay attention to your lexical scoping tho ;)
* width, height, mouseX, mouseY, frameCount

## Animation
* use frameCount and check the reference!

## Interaction
* start off with mouseX and mouseY
